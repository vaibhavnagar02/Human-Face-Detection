# Human-Face-Detection

Face recognition is the problem of identifying and verifying people in a photograph by their face. It is a task that is trivially performed by humans, even under varying light and when faces are changed by age or obstructed with accessories and facial hair. Nevertheless, it has remained a challenging computer vision problem for decades until recently.

Deep learning methods can leverage very large datasets of faces and learn rich and compact representations of faces, allowing modern models to first perform as-well and later to outperform the face recognition capabilities of humans.

With this project we have implemented the following under the face detection umbrella: Implement Bounding Box Regression, Facial Landmark Detection, Blur the Face from the Image, Use Real Time Image Bounding Box. These models have a great significance in various industries including Automobile, Security Access Control, Healthcare and so on.
